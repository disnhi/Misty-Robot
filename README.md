# Misty Research Project Summer 2021 with Professor Jason Wilson

* Collaborative work in assembling a system for a robot to recognize when a user needs help and how to respond accordingly 
* Developed a wrapper in Python and an HDDL file that works cohesively to generate an action script in the form of a JSON file that can be sent off to the robot for execution.
* Import files used within the wrapper were created by a peer (Saad Mahboob) with minor edits from me
     * Integrated using a ‘Misty’ robot, .NET SDK, C#, python, and HTML/CSS
